## What I learned

In this challenge, I practiced creating an email form within an index.html document. I learned the formatting in index.html and how to create a form validation function with JavaScript.

Here is a code snippet of the email form written in the index.html file:

```html
<form class="input" name="form1" action="#">
    <input type="email" id="email" class="err-border" name="email address" placeholder="Email address" required>
    <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Get notified" onclick="ValidateEmail(document.form1.email)">
    <div id="invalid"></div>
    <div id="valid"></div>
    </form>
```
<br/>

This code snippet below is my JavaScript solution for the form validation function, if the input is empty, then checks if the input is a valid or invalid email.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
<br/>

In previous challenges, I have utilized GitHub Desktop to create my repositories and commit changes. Throughout this current project, I focused on applying my skills with Git in the terminal to create my repository and commits. My preference is to use GitHub Desktop, as it allows the visual element of viewing all changes made to the document, as well as giving the option to select which changes to commit - *making it easier to organize commits before pushing them to the repository*. Yet, for continued development, I will continue to use Git within the terminal for my repositories & commits, as it will be a valuable tool for source code management.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools | JS | HTML DOM css](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp) - This resource provided the format for changing the style of a property in the DOM.

- [W3schools | JS | match() method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_match.asp) - This resource helped with email validation and checking if the client input was empty.

- [StackOverflow | JS | validation for empty input field](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3937513/javascript-validation-for-empty-input-field) - This resource helped with creating a function to check if the client input is empty.

- [w3resource | JS | HTML Form | email validation](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php
) - Through this w3resource webpage, I acquired the *Regular Expression Pattern* and valuable details for email validation in JavaScript.
