## What I learned

In this challenge, I practiced creating an email form within an index.html document. I learned the formatting for the index.html and how to create a form validation function with JavaScript.

Here is a code snippet of the email form written in the index.html file:

```html
<form class="input" name="form1" action="#">
  <input type="email" id="email" class="err-border" name="email address" placeholder="Email address" required>
  <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Get notified" onclick="ValidateEmail(document.form1.email)">
  <div id="validation"></div>
</form>
```
<br/>

The code snippet below is my JavaScript solution for the form `ValidateEmail()` function. It checks if the input length is empty, or if text is present - checks if the input is a valid or invalid email according to the regular expression pattern for a valid email address. The document innerHTML and style for the `#validation` will be styled according to the client input within the form.

```js
var mailformat = /^\w+([\.-]?\w+)+@\w+([\.:]?\w+)+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,3})+$/;

function ValidateEmail(inputText) {
  if(inputText.value.length == 0) {
    document.getElementById("validation").innerHTML = "Oops! Please add your email";
    document.getElementById("email").style.outline = "2px solid rgba(255, 41, 101, 1)";
    document.getElementById("validation").style.color = "rgba(255, 41, 101, 1)";
    document.form1.email.focus();
    return this;
  } else if(inputText.value.match(mailformat)) {
    document.getElementById("validation").innerHTML = "Valid email address!";
    document.getElementById("email").style.outline = "2px solid rgba(62, 233, 229, 1)";
    document.getElementById("validation").style.color = "rgba(62, 233, 229, 1)";
    document.form1.email.focus();
    return this;
  } else {
    document.getElementById("validation").innerHTML = "Oops! That doesn't look like a valid email address";
    document.getElementById("email").style.outline = "2px solid rgba(255, 41, 101, 1)";
    document.getElementById("validation").style.color = "rgba(255, 41, 101, 1)";
    document.form1.email.focus();
    return this;
  }
}
```

In previous challenges, I have utilized GitHub Desktop to create my repositories and commit changes. Throughout this current project, I focused on applying my skills with Git in the terminal to create my repository and commits. My preference is to use GitHub Desktop, as it allows the visual element of viewing all changes made to the document, as well as giving the option to select which changes to commit - *making it easier to organize commits before pushing them to the repository*. Yet, for continued development, I will continue to use Git within the terminal for my repositories & commits, as it will be a valuable tool for source code management.
